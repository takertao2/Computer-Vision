# Computer-Vision

Showcase of various computer vision techniques, including AR.

This project demonstrates various uses of homographies and particle filters.
A homography is an isomorphism of projective spaces and is used in this context for calculating the pose of three-dimensional objects for image processing.
Particle filters are sequential Monte Carlo methods, used here for tracking.

The project is fully documented in `report.pdf`.
